     <p>Hard to believe that our last post was about Demo Day for the Sept. 2014 cohort - and now we've got <strong>two</strong> brand-new classes started!
Yesterday, our second Front End cohort jumped off the deep end and straight into their first assignment with David Rogers, the Front End instructor. At the same time, Brian Gates started our the <strong>inaugural Ruby on Rails course!</strong>
Can't wait to see the progress these ladies and gentlemen make over the next 12 weeks!</p>
